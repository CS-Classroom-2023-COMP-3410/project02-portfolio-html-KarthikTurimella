## Reflection on the Portfolio Website Development

Creating this portfolio website was a rewarding experience. The primary challenge was managing broken image paths, especially with DALLÂ·E-generated files. I solved this by renaming files to simpler names and ensuring proper directory referencing. Additionally, I converted unsupported `.webp` images to `.jpg` for compatibility.

Ensuring accessibility was another focus. I added `alt` attributes for images and meaningful page titles. Despite the restriction to HTML only, I used inline styles to create a visually appealing site.

This project improved my troubleshooting and organizational skills, and I am pleased with the outcome.
